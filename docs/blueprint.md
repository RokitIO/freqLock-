# **App Name**: Harmonic Delay Calculator

## Core Features:

- Tempo Input: Input field for Tempo (BPM).
- Root Note Selection: Selection for Root Note (e.g., C3).
- Multiplier Selection: Dropdown for selecting the Multiplier (e.g., 1x, 2x, 0.5x).
- Calculations and Display: Calculates and displays the Frequency of the Root Note, Time per Cycle, Musical Delay Time, and Comparison to Beat Divisions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark teal (#008080) for a professional feel.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds.
- Accent color: Lime green (#32CD32) to highlight calculated values and interactive elements.
- Clean and structured layout with clear sections for input and output.
- Simple, clear icons for musical concepts (e.g., a metronome for BPM, a note for Root Note).

## Original User Request:
üü£ TimeTuned Lite: Tempo x Root Sync
Find delay times that are musically synced to both the tempo (BPM) and the fundamental/root note frequency ‚Äî harmonically and rhythmically.

‚úÖ User Inputs:
Tempo (BPM) ‚Üí e.g. 120

Root Note ‚Üí e.g. C3 (130.81 Hz)

Multiplier (x cycles) ‚Üí e.g. 1x, 2x, 0.5x

üß† What It Does:
It calculates:

üéµ Frequency of Root Note (Hz)

üßÆ Time per Cycle = 1000 / freq (in ms)

‚è± Musical Delay Time =
cycleTime * multiplier (1x = one full cycle, 2x = two cycles, etc.)

üß© Comparison to Beat Divisions:

1 Beat (ms) = 60000 / BPM

See how your cycle-aligned delay relates to 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 etc.

üßÆ Example:
BPM = 120
Root = G3 (196 Hz)
1 Cycle = 1000 / 196 ‚âà 5.10 ms
2x Cycle = ‚âà 10.20 ms
1 Beat = 60000 / 120 = 500 ms
‚Üí 10.20 ms is ~1/49th of a beat = super tight flutter

üí° Use Case:
Layer short delays or early reflections that subtly reinforce the key without stepping on rhythmic timing. Perfect for stereo wideners, slapback, ambient tails, or rhythmic pitch shifting.

‚úÖ Final Output Example:
yaml
Copy
Edit
Root Note: G3 (196.00 Hz)
Tempo: 120 BPM

Base Frequency Cycle: 5.10 ms
x2 Harmonic Cycle: 10.20 ms

1 Beat = 500 ms
Your Delay = 10.20 ms (~1/49th of a beat)

Use for: Transient enhancement, reverb pre-delay, harmonic echoes
